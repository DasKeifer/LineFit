LineFit was started almost ten years ago as a simple command line program in C written 
by Dr. Petcher for the Physics department at Covenant College and has been brought to
a "completed" state by Keith Rice, who is also in charge of LineFit's repository.

LineFit operates on two guiding design principles: That data in elementary physics courses can be fit with a Line in 
most cases and that fitting lines to data should be easy. Because of this, LineFit will
always only allow Linear Fits for its data and has an interface so it is easy to add new
Linear Fits. This project is also open to new features and any bug fixes to help improve
the overall quality of this project as an open source academic tool.

The official version of LineFit is hosted on GitHub.com under the account 
darksideprogramming. This project is also linked up to SourceForge 
(<https://sourceforge.net/projects/linefit/>) to take advantage of their distribution 
functionality for users.
